## Dataset Information

This repository stores a dataset collected from the DBLP computer science bibliography, an on-line reference for bibliographic information on major computer science publications. This dataset includes approximately 15 million records collected in September/2016. 

From this dataset, two sub-datasets were created:
- The first has the original database collected from the DBLP with name deduplication treatment.
- The second presents three co-authorship social networks built using the snowball sampling technique.
